# Contributing to Slpy JS

We welcome all contributions to Slpy JS, and we thank you in advance for your help! 

Below are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository:** This creates a personal copy for you to work on. You'll make changes to your fork, and then propose these changes to the main project.

2. **Clone the repository to your local machine:** So you can start making changes.

3. **Set up the development environment:** Ensure you have installed all the necessary packages and dependencies.

## 👀 Issues

- **Creating an issue:** If you have found a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please create an issue. Describe what happened and what you expected to happen.

- **Assign yourself an issue:** If there is an existing issue that you want to work on, assign it to yourself. This will help avoid duplication of work.

## 👩‍💻 Code Contributions

1. **Create a new branch:** For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the `main` branch. The branch name should reflect the changes you are making.

2. **Test all browsers:** Slpy JS changes should be functional across all browsers and platforms, and be compatible or polyfill capable down to ie9.

3. **Commit your changes:** Make sure your commit messages clearly explain the changes you are making.

4. **Push your changes to your fork:** This makes them available to others.

5. **Create a pull request:** This proposes your changes to the main project. Describe the changes you have made, why you made them, and what effect they will have on the project.

## 🔍 Code Review

After you have created a pull request, one of the project maintainers will review your code. They may ask for changes. This is a normal part of the development process, and it provides a great opportunity to learn.

## 🙌 Thank You
